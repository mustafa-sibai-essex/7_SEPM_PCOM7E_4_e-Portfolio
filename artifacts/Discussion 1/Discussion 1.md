<br>
Instructions: Please read the Itkonen et al. (2014) paper and then answer the following questions:
<br>
What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?
Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast).
<br>

## Answer:

Here are my thoughts after reading Itkonen et al. (2014) paper:
<br>
The three most common reasons for a project failure are as follows.

        <p>
            1.	Lack of talent or skill / Wrong tool: It is very easy to start a project with the wrong foundation/tools. A lot of projects fail because the underlining tool used to accomplish the project is the wrong tool for the job. In order to complete the project successfully, planning and analysis must be done correctly beforehand to figure out what technology/tool must be used for the project. Furthermore, hiring the right people who know that tool/technology well enough to use it properly is important. A lot of companies hire based on short-term bases and don’t look into the future, such as making sure that the software they are developing will be maintained for the next 2, 3, 5, 10 or even 20 years. Contracting and outsourcing the project to different companies can sometimes work. However, it is not the greatest idea in the world.

            2.	Underestimating the project time frame/work: Another reason a project fails is because of underestimating the amount of work, time, or money it takes to accomplish the project. Some project managers don’t consider the time for testing, deploying, things going wrong, or simply inaccurately estimating the project scope or time.

</div>

<div class="container">  
    <div class="text-section"> 
        <p>
            3.	Testing and deployment: It is common for many project managers to hand over a project before ensuring everything works as it should 100% of the time. If the customer were to discover an issue with the final product, it would not only cause the client to lose faith in the company but could also require the company to recall the product and redesign / fix it, which can cost more money than it would take to test the project properly before shipping it.

            An example of a product failure due to lack of testing is the Boeing 737 Max which caused the airplane to crash due to a software failure and improper briefing of the pilot to a new system installed in the aircraft.

            Another example is Hawaii sending a false missile alert to all of its residents. Due to a miss management issue and software failure caused the panic of all of Hawaii residents for 30 minutes thinking they were about to be hit by an incoming missile.

There are far more examples of system/product failers.
