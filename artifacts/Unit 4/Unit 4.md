Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module forum.<br>


## Answer:

While reading Anton & Nucu (2020), I identified the main software development project risks. They are as follows:

<div class="container" aline="left">  
    <div class="text-section"aline="left"> 
1. Lack of communication between the client and the development team.<br>
2. Lack of skill in terms of delivering the project in good quality and in a timely manner<br>
3. False requirement gathering from the client.<br>
</p> 
    </div>  
</div>

<div class="container">  
    <div class="text-section"> 
<p>
Selecting an external company to outsource the work to with a proven track record for excellence in software development, deployment, and maintenance is a great way to mitigate the risk of project failure.
